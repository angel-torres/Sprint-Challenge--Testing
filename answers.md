1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

    `describe()` and `it()` are useful to have hierarchy during testing. `describe()` could useful to give hierarchy to a test suite and `it()` can be useful to give herarchy to a single test.

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

    Test driven development is when developers write the tests for their code before they write their code. This is useful because it helps catch bugs that before they become an issue.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.
    unit testing, integration tests, component testing
